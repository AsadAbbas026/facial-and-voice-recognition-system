Firstly in this application, single audio voice is recorded and stored in the system for comparing two audioes.
Secondly, I compare the audio taken on run-time and audio stored in the system.
Once the runtime audio gets somewhat close to the threshold of the previously stored audio.
The secondary security measure gets awake on point
Face Recognition Application gets into action.
Sample of 10 pictures with multiple indexes is taken at a single execution. Afterwards the pictures are taken to a model trainer and saved into haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml file and then trained on its rules.
Afterwards the Facial Recognition Application works on the pictures only one those which are already sent to the model trainer.
This is the method of security used for any application.
